    <h2>Entertainment media</h2>
    <h3>Not surprisingly, the most common forms of entertainment media that students in our CSCE 445 class enjoyed were</h3>
    <h3>pc videogames such as <a href= "https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a> and <a href= "https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/">League of Legends</a> over console games</h3>
    <h3>which probably has a lot to do with the major of our class.</h3>

    <h3></h3>
    <h3>for social media, mediums such as <a href= "https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.snapchat.com">snapchat</a> where you can be anonymous or much less transparent to others were much more popular than mediums such as Facebook or Twitter</h3>
    <h3>which again is probably due to the demographics of people tending to be computer science majors.</h3>

    <h3>A lot of people watch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/"">Twitch<a> and popular shows such as the <a href="https://www.nbc.com/the-office">Office</a></h3>

    <h3>As for the reason why people took this class, most took this class to learn how we communicate differently due to new media or to satisfy their degree plan.</h3>
