    <h3>A lot of them mentioned Dr.Shipman as a reason for taking Computers and New Media, while no one in our class mentioned Dr.Furuta as a reason for taking this class.</h3>
    <h3>The favored gaming medium for the 2004 class was the xbox or the PS2, unlike our class which was either the Nintendo Switch or the PC.</h3>
    <h3>Some other interesting thiNGs I noted were the common use of house telephones, which are pretty much unused in 2019. I assume Gmail was not invented yet at this time, as everyone used Messenger Outlook, and people listen to MP3s by pirating them (probably on Limewire) instead of using apps like Spotify or Apple Music,</h3>
